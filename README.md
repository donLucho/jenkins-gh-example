## The party of Barrabas
Barrabas was the son of a father&hellip;their father (e.g. -- a son of hell) and was released by the Pharisees when Jesus was on trial under Pilate, the Roman governor over 2000 years ago. And, we all know how that worked out in the end!

Today, if &quot;Covid-45&quot; is not tried for insurrection subsequent to the events of January 6, 2021, then, le-America can count on the imminent removal of their blessings by God the Father, God the Anointed Son of Abba (Jesus Christ, in other words) and God the Holy Spirit. 

Mark my words! Or, to quote Jack Pallance from Young Guns, "Get ready for hell!"
